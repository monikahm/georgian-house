          Statue of “Tamada” from VII century B.C. discovered in Vani city and
          now exhibited at National Museum of Georgia.GEORGIA -CRADLE OF
          WINEAccording to archeologic data, Georgian’s rela-tion with vine and
          wine is observed from early stag-es. Qvevri widely used in Georgia for
          winemaking is similar to vessels from Neolithic area. What proves,
          that wine culture in this area has long historic routes and defines
          continuity of this process. It is very im-portant that we have not
          only one episode, but the entire picture of the story. We started wine
          produc-tion in ancient times and continue this activity now-adays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Study of monuments of Neolithic area on the ter-ritory of Georgia (VI
          century B.C.) was initiated in 60s of XX century. During this process
          wine vessel was discovered, which allowed researchers society of XX
          century to assume, that Georgia was the moth-erland of wine. In 1999,
          “Vinopolis” was opened in London, where Georgian corner was
          established. This exposition was named- “Georgia- Motherland of Wine”.
          Here, based on samples stored in State Museum of Georgia history of
          Georgian wine was re-produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assumption, that Georgia is the motherland of wine was first mentioned
          by famous writer Hugh Johnson in his book “History of Wine”, which was
          published in 1989. Later, similar assumption was made by acknowledge
          wine history researcher, pro-fessor of Pennsylvania university-
          Patrick McGovern, who traveled Georgia in 1998. In 2003 he published
          his book “Ancient Wine”, where he mentioned, that motherland of wine
          is possibly Caucasus area. His assumptions were based on archeological
          discoveries mentioned above and grape seeds discovered. How-ever,
          unfortunately international society did not ap-prove this discovery,
          as vessels and seeds could not be dated for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2006, national museum was tasked to renew the exposition at
          “Vinopolis”. From this time, research of wine related topics and
          sharing results with in-ternational society has become our major
          direction. Also, from the same period of time archaeological studies
          of Neolithic monuments was renewed. Re-newal of the studies aimed at
          support of wine culture studies. Statue of “Tamada” from VII century
          B.C. discovered in Vani city and now exhibited at Nation-al Museum of
          Georgia has become its symbol. In 2008, professor Patrick McGovern
          visit Georgia again and held lecture on study of chemical compo-sition
          of ancient wine. Several times, symposium for wine community,
          including Qvevri was organized.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2014, “Georgian Wine” association and Na-tional Wine Agency of
          Georgia initiated an inter-national project- “Georgian vine and wine
          culture study”. Along with Georgian scientists, internation-al
          scientist from Pennsylvania, Montpelier, Milan, Copenhagen, Toronto
          Universities, Israel Weisman university and Montpelier National
          Institute of Ag-ricultural Research (INRA) also participated in the
          project. In the scope of the project, professor of Pennsylvania
          university- Patrick McGovern facili-tated biomolecular study. Clay
          vessels discovered during archeological study of Neolithic area
          mon-uments in “Gadachrili Gori” and “Shulaveris Gori” located in
          Marneuli region, proved presence of or-ganic acids characteristic to
          wines. These acids are the markers of wines produced from Vitis
          Vinefera

      <h2>Qvevri Wine</h2>
      <div className="wine-history wine__full-height">
        <p>
          In Georgia, winemaking in Qvevri started 8,000 years ago, and this
          tradition is still maintained. In 2013 UNESCO has added the
          traditional Georgian method of winemaking in Qvevri in the list of the
          World Intangible Cultural Heritage. This points to the uniqueness and
          significance of this method, and it is a message to the whole world
          that wine is an integral part of the ancient Georgian culture. This
          recognition is important for raising the awareness of Qvevri wines and
          supports the worldwide promotion of the Georgian wines.
          <p>Storing temperature: +12- +16. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Qvevri is a unique clay vessel for making and storing wine. The oldest
          Qvevri type vessels found in Georgia belong to the VI-V millennium BC.
          The current Georgian Qvevri’s shape was formed in the III-II
          millennium. Prior to this time, there were widespread mainly small
          Qvevris that were not larger than 1-1.5 meters in height and had a
          flat foot and wide belly. At present the most widespread are
          egg-shaped Qvevris. The Qvevri’s capacity starts from several hundred
          liters and reaches several tons. Kakheti is especially distinguished
          for its large Qvevris, where you can find Qvevris with capacity of 6-8
          thousand liters. The most common are 1-2-tones Qvevris.
        </p>
        <p>
          Winemaking process in Qvevri generally involves fermentation of sweet
          grape juice with a certain amount of pomace (mash of pips, skins and
          stalks - called chacha in Georgian). The first and most important rule
          of winemaking in Qvevri is to leave grape juice together with its
          pomace, both during fermentation and after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Winemaking technology differs in different parts of Georgia. For
          example, in Kakheti the alcoholic fermentation includes the total
          amount of chacha (pomace), while fermentation by Imeretian method
          involves adding up to a third of the total chacha to the grape juice
          in the Qvevri.
        </p>
        <p>
          For determination of the period for wine making with chacha, it is
          important to take into account the grape variety, the duration of
          alcoholic fermentation itself, environmental conditions, etc.
          Generally, the red wine stays in Qvevri only during the fermentation
          period, it can be 7-10 days, maximum 2 weeks. In the case of white
          grapes, the wine stays with chacha until spring. The white wine, which
          was stored with chacha for a long period, has a dark brown, golden or
          tea color. It is transparent and sparkling, characterized by fruit
          tones and a moderate content of tannins and is naturally stable. Clay
          used for Qvevri-making contains limestone and small amounts of
          precious metals - gold, silver and copper. Lime, which reacts with the
          acid of wine, strengthens the walls of the Qvevri on the one hand, and
          on the other hand - acts as a natural antiseptic, which is very
          important in winemaking, where up to 400 species of bacteria are
          known.
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes an average of 3 months to make a Qvevri. Most of the time is
          spent on formation and drying. After Qvevri is formed, it is placed in
          the oven, where the most difficult stage of roasting begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temperature inside the Qvevri buried in the ground does not change
          and keeps constant at 13 -15° -the temperature required for wine
          fermentation. In the Qvevri the chemical processes for wine making are
          going naturally and in the relevant chronological order, at a factory
          production for this are necessary special equipment and additives.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the wine fermentation, it needs frequent mixing - 4-5 times a
          day. At the end of fermentation, grape skins, stalks and pips begin to
          sink and accumulate on the bottom of the Qvevri. Under the pressure
          the chacha covers by the wine sediment, which separates it from the
          wine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one of the main winemaking regions of Georgian - in Kakheti,
          Qvevris are buried under ground in a wine cellar, in western Georgia -
          Qvevris are hermetically sealed and kept at the open air.
